Project created for controlling Nvidia 3D Vision glasses by a python daemon.

We have to merge our two projects:
- usbdir from kunguz (http://code.google.com/p/pyusbir/source/browse/trunk/source/lib/usbir.py)
- shutters_nv from Magestik (http://github.com/magestik/TuxStereoViewer/blob/master/shutters_nv.py)

Maybe we should merge the two projects, then we'll make the daemon part.
The project has to separe the daemon from the controller, so we could add some other 3D glasses support.
